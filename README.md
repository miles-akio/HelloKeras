## Project Overview

The **HelloKeras** project aims to provide hands-on examples of solving common machine learning problems using Keras, a powerful deep learning library built on TensorFlow. Each notebook walks through the process of:

- Loading and preprocessing datasets
- Defining and compiling Keras models
- Training and evaluating models
- Visualizing results to interpret the outcomes

The project is a great starting point for anyone looking to learn about deep learning basics in Python.

## Notebook Details

### Binary Classification (`bin_class.ipynb`)

This notebook demonstrates solving a binary classification problem using Keras. It uses a dataset (e.g., breast cancer or Titanic) to predict a binary outcome such as whether a patient has a disease or not. Key steps include:

- Loading and exploring the dataset
- Preprocessing and normalizing features
- Building a neural network with a sigmoid activation function
- Evaluating the model using metrics like accuracy and AUC
- Plotting training loss and accuracy

---

### Regression (`reg.ipynb`)

This notebook addresses a regression problem, such as predicting housing prices based on features like area, number of rooms, etc. It includes:

- Importing a dataset (e.g., Boston housing or a custom CSV)
- Visualizing data with scatterplots and distributions
- Creating a model with a linear activation function for continuous output
- Computing metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared
- Visualizing prediction vs. actual values

---

### Multi-Class Classification (`mul_class.ipynb`)

This notebook showcases multi-class classification with a dataset like MNIST (handwritten digits). It walks through:

- Loading the dataset and reshaping inputs
- Encoding labels using one-hot encoding
- Building a deep neural network with softmax activation for multi-class output
- Evaluating metrics such as categorical crossentropy and accuracy
- Visualizing misclassified samples
